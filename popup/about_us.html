      <p>
        We are a dedicated team of three university students working on an
        innovative project for our Formal Languages and Compiler course. Our
        project involves developing a Firefox extension designed to analyze and
        simplify privacy policies on websites.

        <strong>Angelo Milella</strong><br />I am a student and a former
        consultant at Deloitte, currently working to build a tech development
        team with the goal of launching a startup. My professional background in
        consulting, combined with my academic focus, fuels my commitment to
        advancing technology and enhancing user experiences.

        <strong>Our Tool</strong><br />Our tool aims to make privacy policies
        more accessible and comprehensible for users. By analyzing the text of
        privacy policies on websites, our extension provides clear summaries and
        key insights, helping users make informed decisions about their online
        privacy. This tool will streamline the process of understanding complex
        legal language and highlight important privacy practices, ultimately
        fostering greater transparency in the digital world.

        <strong>Academic Foundation</strong><br />Our project is grounded in
        research and methodologies provided by our professor at Politecnico di
        Bari. We have extensively studied the sources and papers recommended,
        which have guided our approach to developing a robust and effective
        tool. This academic foundation ensures that our solution is both
        innovative and grounded in scholarly research.
