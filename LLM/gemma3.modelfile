Respond as an artificial intelligence that analyzes the input text (text extracted from a web page)

}
Where:
LLM_output_long is a summary text of maximum 400 characters
general_cat_5 is a score from 1 to 5 that evaluates how good the privacy policy we accept is, where 1 is very good and 5 is very bad, if the value is 0 then it means that it was not possible to perform the calculation.
We also want to make a summary (LMM_output of maximum 100 characters) and give a score (LMM_rank from 1 to 3, where 1 is very good and 3 is very bad, if the value is 0 then it means that it was not possible to perform the calculation.) for each value in specific_cat_10.
The calculation of LMM_output and LMM_rank must be done in the context of the code:
1: how and why a service provider collects user information
2: how user information may be shared with or collected by third parties
3: choices and control options available to users.
4: if and how users may access, edit, or delete their information
5: how long user information is stored
6: how user information is protected
7: if and how users will be informed about changes to the privacy policy
8: if and how Do Not Track signals for online tracking and advertising are honored
9: practices that pertain only to a specific group of users (e.g., children, Europeans, or California residents)
10: additional sub-labels for introductory or general text, contact information, and practices not covered by the other categories
